# Language Analysis

## by Katherine (Kate) Maaschmeyer

### Course: Game Development in Racket
This course would ideally be an elective for 8th grade students who are taking Algebra or would like a peek at some Algebra concepts by writing a game in Racket.

### Language: Racket

### How to write/run code: 
Using an IDE: DrRacket, Replit

### Complexity of Syntax:
Relatively simple

### Strengths:  
* Functional programming language
* Reinforces what students are learning in math classes
* Syntax supports students in writing examples themselves -- can support students moving from concrete to abstract
* Can quickly implement & see highly visual results
* Can use to create web applications
* Has a rich set of libraries (web server apps,  mathematics and scientific simulation software)
* Can create pattern-based macros

  
#### Use of strengths in class:
* Reinforce mathematical concepts: use of variables, function, discussion of domain/ range
* Build examples together so students have sense of where variables can/should be used
* Students can quickly build a game - high engagement!
* Might actually use Pyret, a programming language uses Racket's mathematical behavior, but the sybtax is similar to Python.

### Weaknesses:
* Syntax is different than many programming languages they might use in the future


#### Mitigation of weaknesses in class:
* Start with Racket, transition to Pyret (which could support later transition to Python)

### Why chosen: 
I enjoyed teaching Bootstrap: Algebra with Racket as a part of my Algebra class.  Students made great connections to the math we were covering and loved making a game!  Due to curriculum and school changes, we no longer have time to cover Bootstrap: Algebra in class, so I think it could be a great elective.
