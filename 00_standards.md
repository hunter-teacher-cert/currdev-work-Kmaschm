# Exploration of How Lessons Address NYS CS Standards

## by Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer

## Prompt 
Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.

## Standard #1: 4-6.CT.7/7-8.CT.7

* 4-6.CT.7 Identify pieces of information that might change as a program or process runs.
* 7-8.CT.7 Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.

###  Lesson: Variables

#### Link to lesson: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1iObX-wWnBr305eYDrWRrnmWo2l6rV_86bIFiqrnUw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlI4MLIjhaenLNctNWewAQSjCv633tLUiKo8csyl1FE/edit)

#### Description:
Students build on their knowledge of built-in p5 variables to delcare, instantiate, and use their own variables:  students are given the "headache" of wanting to draw a bullseye design created with  several ellipses in several locations on the canvas (changing ones mind about location, then moving it, & rerunning code), then introduced to the "aspirin" of using a custom-made variable.  Students practice creating and using a custom-made variable by recreating a poster design.  

* **Do Now: Bullseye:**  Students identify which arguments would need to be changed to move a bullseye design to a different spot on the canvas. 
* **Discussion: Variables:** Students determine values for arguments from Do Now and teacher live-codes changes.  Teacher posits changing location of bullseye again, then introduces idea of variables.
* **Teacher Demo: Variables:** Teacher walks students through an algorithm of creating a custom variable within the context of moving the bullseye in the x-direction.
    1. Decide which values are changing/varying.
    2. Declare the variable.
    3. Initialize the variable.
    4. Use the variable.

* **Exploration and Practice:**
  * Students turn and talk about why the bullseye moves when the xLocation variable changes.
  * Students fork the sketch and use the same algoruthm to create & use a yLocation variable and later a size variable.

* **Student Activity: Pair Programming - Poster Recreation:** Students recreate a poster design that contains repeated drawings of cricles that vary in the y-direction.
* 
* **Wrap Up:** Discussion about pair programming and sharing of sketches.  


### Explanation:
Students identify that the x and y values in ellipse will change when moving the bullseye pattern.  Students then remix the bullseye code to create and use yLocation and size variables.  In the pair programming activity, students add on to a sketch using a variable to maintain the current value of the y-location of the ellipses.


## Standard #2: 4-6.CT.4 / 7-8.CT.4
* 4-6.CT.4 Decompose a problem into smaller named tasks, some of which can themselves be decomposed into smaller steps.
* 7-8.CT.4 Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task.


###  Lesson: Functions and Parameters

#### Link to lesson: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12FegnYkP5jOTOPVvQiuFWhwP1Gkwbs2F1bPfS-m_BVo/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12FegnYkP5jOTOPVvQiuFWhwP1Gkwbs2F1bPfS-m_BVo/edit)

#### Description:
Students learn about p5.js functions and parameters and how to use the p5.js reference.  They will recreate a sketch of a face by deconstructing it into smaller shapes and using the functions for each shape. 

* **Do Now: Lines:** Students practice their p5 coordinate grid skills by determining the parameters to create specified lines.
* **Discussion: Functions and Parameters:**  Students are introduced to the ideas of functions, parameters, and arguments.
* **Teacher Demo: Layering shapes:** Students review how to draw squares and circles using their appropriate functions, then explore how changing the order of functions changes the order in which shapes are drawn (last shape is on top).
* **Student Activity: Recreate p5 sketches:** Students are introduced to comments, then recreate a given sketch with comments to indicate which lines of code are for face, left eye, right eye and nose.

* **Wrap Up:**  Students submit code as exit ticket.

### Explanation: 
Students decompose a given sketch into smaller parts, down to the shapes needed to create each piece.  Students then use functions like rect, ellipse to recreate the given sketch.
