# Assignments for Unit Plan

## by Katherine (Kate) Maaschmeyer

### Mouse Movement Lab 
(Small individual work)
Students are given starter code with 1 simple square sprite in the middle.

Task:
Using the mouse functions, 
1. Square turns red when you mouse over it.
2. Square turns green when you click it
3. If you click and drag the square you can change its position

Challenge: Mix this code with the sprite lab. Change between sprite looks when the mouse interacts with the sprite.


### Groups Lab
(Group work - more open ended, leading toward a game)
Students work in partnerships to explore how to use Groups.

Prior knowledge:
* Students have coded a sprite with p5play.
* Students have creates a mini game in p5play: sprites with collision, keyboard movement, keeping score/having a win condition.  

Learning Targets: 
* I can create and modify a Group of sprites with p5play.
* I can create interaction between a non-Grouped sprite and a group of sprites.

1. Create a Group of sprites.  
2. Set at least 3 properties for the group. 
3. Use indexing to change a property of 1 of your sprites in the group.
4. Create a non-Grouped sprite.
5. Have the non-Grouped sprite interact with the Group sprites in some way (can use movement of Group and collision)

Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan.
Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file. Save this file in your own personal work repository.
This is individual work, that can be incorperated into your unit plan later.
