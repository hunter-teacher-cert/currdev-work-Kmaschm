### Tool #1: Replit (Teams for Education) 

* **General Purpose**: IDE. Replit is an integrated development environment.
* **Class I use this tool in**: CS/Coding class
* **How it's used in class**:  I use Replit Teams for Education to manage my students coding work:
* **Why did I select it?**:  It does what I need, has features to support executive functioning (limited number of steps for regulary tasks), and is free!
  * Students can code in p5, see results quickly, but unlike the p5 editor (https://editor.p5js.org/), students do not need to remember to save code. 
  * I can also set up all of the resources for students for a given lesson in one template and push it out to students (no duplication or forking needed) via Google classroom quickly.
  * It is easy to view, comment on, or display student code.  (p5 editor would require me to have a spreadsheet of urls and usernames; Replit Teams lets me look at submissions for each lesson/task quickly.)  Students can also easily present their work on the board/projector as desired.
  * Students can work in groups on the same code if desired. 

### Tool #2: Desmos Activity Builder

* **General Purpose**: Create and use interactive activities for students - originally intended for Math
* **Class I use this tool in**: Algebra and CS/Coding class
* **How it's used in CS/Coding class**:  I have built activities for students to explore the p5 coordinate grid and to support students in writing p5 code (visualizing shapes, reminders of how each function is used). During any project or lesson where students will need to code shapes, they can use a support activity to visualize the shapes they'd like to add and get reminders of how to code their shapes. The slides act as personalized, interactive anchor charts for students.   I am also working on Desmos activities to support students with coding interactivity in p5.  
* **Why did I select it?**:  It's free, relatively easy to use, has lots of functionality and is being updated with helpful features regularly.
