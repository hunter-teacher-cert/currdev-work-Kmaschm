# Comparing Curricula by Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer

## Curricula to compare:
* Current curriculum: CS4All NYC's Creative Web (CW)
 https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/curriculum/creative-web/
* Similar course: CS4All NYC's Introduction to Computational Media (ICM): https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/introduction-to-computational-media-curriculum/


## Major Similarities:
Both:
* are creative coding courses focused on p5.js, a visual library of Javascript.
* are developed and maintained by teachers and staff through CS4All NYC
* cover drawing; interactivity with variables, conditionals, and logical operators; custom functions
* actively support and encourage teachers to use (and if needed modify) lessons/projects to better teach CRE
* use Custom Emojji and Traffic Light as student projects

## Major Differences:
| Creative Web | ICM |
|---|---|
| Designed for middle school students |  Designed for high school students to be a good prep for AP CSP |
| 3 units, 1 semester or full year depending on how often classes meet| 5 units, full year course | 
| Curriculum lessons are each in their own Google docs, but do have flow for each lesson (Warm Up, Mini Lesson, Teacher Demo, Student Activity, Exit Ticket) | Curriculum is all in gitbooks and have flow arranged for lessons | 
| PD for curriculum often talks about introducing students to learning zones and how to notice/reset if entering panic zone | Curriculum (and likely PD) has information on Impostor Syndrome |
| introduces students to the Document Object Model | Covers loops, arrays, intro image manipulation, rotation, and building a custom function library | 


## Strengths/Weaknesses
* Strength: ICM's gitbooks format is very easy to navigate.  I'm hoping to develop a similar gitbooks setup for CW in the future as the CW organization.
  
## Adopting from ICM
* I plan to adopt the used of the collide2D.js community-developed library when covering interactivity in my CS class.  My students are interested in making shapes moved and determining when different shapes have collided, but don't yet have the math skills to do this without the use of this library.  I believe they can learn to use the library (with support).  I'll be developing a lesson on use of the collide2D.js library for CW supporting materials this month.
